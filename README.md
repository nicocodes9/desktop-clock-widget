### üõ†Ô∏è Build from Source

If you're a developer or prefer to build the application yourself, follow these steps:

#### **Prerequisites**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

#### **Steps**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/nicocodes9/desktop-clock-widget.git
   cd electron-clock-widget
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the Application:**

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

   This command will create a distributable `.exe` installer for Windows (64-bit) in the `dist` folder.

## üé® Customization

You can easily customize the clock's appearance and position by editing the source code:

### **Font**

- Place your desired `.otf` or `.ttf` font file in the root directory of the project (next to `index.html`).
- Open `index.html` and update the `src` URL in the `@font-face` rule:
  ```css
  @font-face {
    font-family: "CustomFont"; /* You can change this name too */
    src: url("YourNewFont.otf") format("opentype"); /* Update this path/filename */
  }
  ```
- Update the `font-family` in the `body` style if you changed `CustomFont`.

### **Size & Color**

- Edit the `font-size` and `color` properties within the `<style>` tags in `index.html` for `.day`, `.date`, and `.time` classes.

### **Position**

- Open `main.js`.
- Adjust `width` and `height` in `BrowserWindow` options for the overall widget size.
- Modify `yPosition` calculation (`height * 0.20`) to change the vertical position.
- Adjust `x` calculation (`(width - 400) / 2`) if you change the width of the `BrowserWindow` and want to keep it centered.

> After making changes, you'll need to rebuild the application (`npm run build`) and reinstall it to see the updates.
